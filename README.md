# Spectrum-ASD-Tool
üë©üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Deep Learning Tool For Autism Screening

## Introduction
An early diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders can improve treatment and significantly decrease associated healthcare costs. In this GUI-based tool, healthcare professionals and teachers can use supervised learning to diagnose Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral features and individual characteristics. Spectrum uses a neural network from the Keras API.

## Dataset
Data Set Name: Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Children 

The dataset that we're going to be using for this chapter is the Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Children Dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Autistic+Spectrum+Disorder+Screening+Data+for+Children++. This dataset contains records of 292 patients or children that have been screened for autism. This contains details of their age, ethnicity, and familial history of autism. We will be using this dataset to predict whether these patients actually have autism.

Abstract: Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment  condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis.  The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features (AQ-10-Child) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science.
